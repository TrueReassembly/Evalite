# Evalite: The Free and Open Source Solution to Minecraft Server Cores.

## Let's be honest
Paid server cores suck, they are black boxes with sketchy anti-piracy / account sharing systems and TOS rules. Worst part is, if something breaks then you need to wait on them to fix it. So after a plugin broke on me one too many times I decided to just make my own and give it to all of you!

## (Planned) Features
Okay, I'll admit it. The plugin isn't ready yet, I'm still currently coding it all. But here is the current planned feature set:
### Database Tables
- Punishments
- Ranks
- Grants
- Users
- IPs
- Punishment Ladder Data
- Punishment Ladder Entries

### Features
- Punishments
- - Add option for silent by default
- - /punish
- - Punishment ladders
- Granting menu
- In-Game Rank editor
- Cross Network communication with Redis
- Staff tools
- /disguise
- 2FA
- Gamemode Commands
- Chat Formatting
- Tab formatting
- Build mode

### Development Features
- Library to handle user input in various means
